	DinnerCrunch is a fresh take on recipe sharing applications. Chefs (on DC, everyone is a chef) enjoy a unique recipe uploader which will soon automatically calculate nutritional information, organizational tools to maintain cookbooks, and grocery lists to get you out of the supermarket faster. Head to <a href="https://dinnercrunch.com/" target="_blank">dinnercrunch.com</a> to check it out.
	<br /><br />
	The brainchild of Will McCartney, I began working on DinnerCrunch in January of this year. Being the only developer on the team, I have been able to work faster than ever before. After a mere four months of developing from scratch, we are gearing up for marketing efforts and plan to create a strong community of users within a few months.
	<br /><br />
	As with the majority of my projects, DinnerCrunch is built on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> with a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> database.
	<br /><br />
	Also feel free to check out <a href="https://dinnercrunch.com/chef/eric/" target="_blank">my DC profile</a> and see what I've been cooking.
